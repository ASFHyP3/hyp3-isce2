# HyP3 ISCE2 Plugin

The HyP3-ISCE2 plugin provides a set of workflows to process SAR satellite data using the [InSAR Scientific Computing Environment 2](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2) (ISCE2) software package. This plugin is part of the [Alaska Satellite Facility's](https://asf.alaska.edu) larger HyP3 (Hybrid Plugin Processing Pipeline) system, which is a batch processing pipeline designed for on-demand processing of SAR data.

## Usage
The HyP3-ISCE2 plugin provides a set of workflows (accessible directly in Python or via a CLI) that can be used to process SAR data using ISCE2. The workflows currently included in this plugin are:

- `insar_tops`: A workflow for creating full-SLC Sentinel-1 geocoded unwrapped interferogram using ISCE2's TOPS processing workflow 
- `insar_tops_burst`: A workflow for creating single-burst Sentinel-1 geocoded unwrapped interferogram using ISCE2's TOPS processing workflow 
---

To run a workflow, simply run `python -m hyp3_isce2 ++process [WORKFLOW_NAME] [WORKFLOW_ARGS]`. For example, to run the `insar_tops_burst` workflow:

```
python -m hyp3_isce2 ++process insar_tops_burst \
  S1_136231_IW2_20200604T022312_VV_7C85-BURST \
  S1_136231_IW2_20200616T022313_VV_5D11-BURST \
  --looks 20x4 \
  --apply-water-mask True
```

This command will create a Sentinel-1 interferogram that contains a deformation signal related to a 
2020 Iranian earthquake. 

### Product Merging Utility Usage
**This feature is under active development and is subject to change!**

Burst InSAR products created using the `insar_tops_burst` workflow can be merged together using the `merge_tops_burst` workflow. This can be useful when the deformation signal you'd like to observe spans multiple bursts. It can be called using the following syntax:
```
python -m hyp3_isce2 ++process merge_tops_bursts \
  PATH_TO_UNZIPPED_PRODUCTS \
  --apply-water-mask True
```
Where `PATH_TO_UNZIPPED_PRODUCTS` is the path to a directory containing unzipped burst InSAR products. For example:
```bash
PATH_TO_UNZIPPED_PRODUCTS/
├─ S1_136232_IW2_20200604_20200616_VV_INT80_663F/
├─ S1_136231_IW2_20200604_20200616_VV_INT80_529D/
```
In order to be merging eligible, all burst products must:
1. Have the same reference and secondary dates
1. Have the same polarization
1. Have the same multilooking
1. Be from the same relative orbit
1. Be contiguous

The workflow should through an error if any of these conditions are not met.

**Merging burst InSAR products requires extra data that is not contained in the production HyP3 Burst InSAR products. For the time being, to be merging eligible burst products must be created locally using your own installation of `hyp3-isce2` from the `merge_bursts` branch of this repository!**

As mentioned above this feature is under active development, so we welcome any feedback you have!

### Options
To learn about the arguments for each workflow, look at the help documentation 
(`python -m hyp3_isce2 ++process [WORKFLOW_NAME] --help`).

#### Looks Option
When ordering Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR On Demand products, users can choose the number of **looks** (`--looks`) to use 
in processing, which drives the resolution and pixel spacing of the output products. The available options are 
20x4, 10x2, or 5x1. The first number indicates the number of looks in range, the second is the number of looks 
in azimuth.

The output product pixel spacing depends on the number of looks in azimuth:
pixel spacing = 20 * azimuth looks

Products with 20x4 looks have a pixel spacing of 80 m, those with 10x2 looks have a pixel spacing of 40 m, and
those with 5x1 looks have a pixel spacing of 20 m.

#### Water Mask Option
There is always a water mask geotiff file included in the product package, but setting the **apply-water-mask** 
(`--apply-water-mask`) option to True will apply the mask to the wrapped interferogram prior to phase unwrapping.

### Earthdata Login and ESA Credentials

For all workflows, the user must provide their Earthdata Login credentials and ESA Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) credentials in order to download input data.
If you do not already have an Earthdata account, you can sign up [here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home). 
If you do not already have a CDSE account, you can sign up [here](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu). 
Your credentials can be passed to the workflows via command-line options (`--esa-username` and  `--esa-password`), environment variables 
(`EARTHDATA_USERNAME`, `EARTHDATA_PASSWORD`, `ESA_USERNAME`, and `ESA_PASSWORD`), or via your `.netrc` file. If you haven't set up a `.netrc` file 
before, check out this [guide](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/docs#getting-started) to get started.

### Docker Container
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a docker container that can run ISCE2 workflows within a HyP3 
deployment. To run the current version of the project's container, use this command:
```
docker run -it --rm \
    -e EARTHDATA_USERNAME=[YOUR_USERNAME_HERE] \
    -e EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=[YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE] \
    -e ESA_USERNAME=[YOUR_USERNAME_HERE] \
    -e ESA_PASSWORD=[YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE] \
    ghcr.io/asfhyp3/hyp3-isce2:latest \
    ++process [WORKFLOW_NAME] \
    [WORKFLOW_ARGS]
```

**NOTE** Each workflow can also be accessed via an alternative CLI with the format (`[WORKFLOW_NAME] [WORKFLOW_ARGS]`)

## Developer Setup
1. Ensure that conda is installed on your system (we recommend using [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) to reduce setup times).
2. Download a local version of the `hyp3-isce2` repository (`git clone https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-isce2.git`)
3. In the base directory for this project call `mamba env create -f environment.yml` to create your Python environment, then activate it (`mamba activate hyp3-isce2`)
4. Finally, install a development version of the package (`python -m pip install -e .`)

To run all commands in sequence use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-isce2.git
cd hyp3-isce2
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate hyp3-isce2
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Background
HyP3 is broken into two components: the cloud architecture/API that manage processing of HyP3 workflows, and Docker container plugins that contain scientific workflows which produce new science products from a variety of data sources (see figure below for the full HyP3 architecture).

![Cloud Architecture](images/arch_here.jpg)

The cloud infratstructure-as-code for HyP3 can be found in the main [HyP3 repository](https://github.com/asfhyp3/hyp3). This repository contains a plugin that can be used to process ISCE2-based processing of SAR data.

This project was heavily influenced by the [DockerizedTopsApp](https://github.com/ACCESS-Cloud-Based-InSAR/DockerizedTopsApp) project, which contains a similar workflow that is designed to produce ARIA Sentinel-1 Geocoded Unwrapped Interferogram standard products via HyP3.
