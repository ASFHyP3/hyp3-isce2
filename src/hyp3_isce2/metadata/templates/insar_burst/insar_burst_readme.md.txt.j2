ASF Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR Data Package (ISCE2)
===============================================

This folder contains burst-based SAR Interferometry (InSAR) products and their associated files. The source data for
these products are Sentinel-1 bursts, extracted from Single Look Complex (SLC) products processed by ESA,
and they were processed using InSAR Scientific Computing Environment version 2 (ISCE2) software.

Refer to
https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-mission#S1Mission-InterferometricWideSwathS1-Mission-Interferometric-Wide-Swath
for more information on Sentinel-1 bursts.

This data was processed by ASF DAAC HyP3 {{ processing_date.year }} using the {{ plugin_name }} plugin version
{{ plugin_version }} running {{ processor_name }} release {{ processor_version }}.
Files are projected to {{ projection }}, and the pixel spacing is {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

The source bursts for this InSAR product are:
 - Reference: {{ reference_burst_name }}
 - Secondary: {{ secondary_burst_name }}

Processing Date/Time: {{ processing_date.isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}

The directory name for this product is: {{ product_name }}

The output directory uses the following naming convention:

S1_bbbbbb_xxn_yyyymmdd_yyyymmdd_pp_INTzz_cccc

bbbbbb: Relative burst ID values assigned by ESA. Each value identifies a consistent burst footprint; relative burst
        ID values differ from one subswath to the next.

xxn: Three character combination that represents the acquisition mode and subswath number. The first two characters
        xx represent the acquisition mode (IW or EW) and the last character identifies the subswath number
        (1-3 for IW, 1-5 for EW). IW mode indicates Interferometric Wideswath, which acquires a 250 km swath composed
        of three subswaths. EW mode indicates Extra-Wide Swath, which acquires a 400 km swath composed of 5 subswaths.

yyyymmdd: Date of acquisition of the reference and secondary images, respectively.

pp: Two character combination that represents the mode of radar orientation (polarization) for both signal
        transmission and reception. The first position represents the transmit orientation mode and the second
        position represents the receive orientation mode.

    HH: Horizontal Transmit - Horizontal Receive
    HV: Horizontal Transmit - Vertical Receive
    VH: Vertical Transmit - Horizontal Receive
    VV: Vertical Transmit - Vertical Receive

INT: The product type (always INT for InSAR).

zz: The pixel spacing of the output image.

cccc: 4-character unique product identifier.

Files contained in the product directory are named using the directory name followed by a tag indicating the file type.

# Burst InSAR Processing #

The basic steps in Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR processing are as follows:

*Pre-Processing*
1. Download the Sentinel SLC burst data
2. Calculate the intersection area
3. Download the dem covering the intersection area
4. Download the aux calibration file
5. Download the orbit parameter files
6. Set the Configure file for the InSAR process

*InSAR Processing*
7. Run topsApp steps 'start' and 'preprocess'
8. Switch the reference and secondary bursts as necessary
9. Run topsApp step 'computeBaselines' to 'filter'
10. Optionally apply the water mask to the wrapped image.
11. Run topsApp steps 'unwrap' and 'unwrap2stage'
12. Run step 'geocode'

*Post-Processing*
13. translate output files to hyp3-gamma format
14. write the README text file
15. write the metadata txt file
16. zip the output files
17. upload the files to s3

----------------
The detailed process, including the calls to ISCE2 software, is as follows:

The prepare-processing and InSAR processing are combined in the insar_tops_burst function.

## Pre-processing ##
 - burst2safe: Download reference and secondary SAFE files containing only the desired bursts
 - get_isce2_burst_bbox: Get the burst bounding boxes for the DEM region of interest
 - download_dem_for_isce2 : Download the DEM file
 - download_aux_cal: Download: the aux cal file
 - downloadSentinelOrbitFile: Download the orbit file
 - topsapp.TopsappBurstConfig: Set the configuration file

## InSAR processing ##
The ISCE2 InSAR processing this product uses includes the following ISCE2 topsApp steps:
- startup
- preprocess
- computeBaselines
- verifyDEM
- topo
- subsetoverlaps
- coarseoffsets
- coarseresamp
- overlapifg
- prepesd
- esd
- rangecoreg
- fineoffsets
- fineresamp
- ion
- burstifg
- mergebursts
- filter
- unwrap
- unwrap2stage
- geocode

These steps are run using these calls within hyp3-isce2:
- topsapp.run_topsapp_burst(start='startup', end='preprocess', config_xml=config_path): Extract the orbits,
        IPF (Instrument Processing Facility) version, burst data, and antenna pattern if it is necessary
- topsapp.swap_burst_vrts(): Switch the reference and secondary bursts to use the burst data download from ASF
- topsapp.run_topsapp_burst(start='computeBaselines', end='unwrap2stage', config_xml=config_path):
    Run the remaining processing steps including:
    - Calculate the perpendicular and parallel baselines
    - Verify the DEM file to make sure it covers the bursts
    - Map DEM into the radar coordinates of the reference image. This generates the longitude,
            latitude, height and LOS angles on a pixel by pixel grid for each burst.
    - Estimate the azimuth offsets between the input SLCs (The Enhanced Spectral Diversity (ESD) method is NOT used)
    - Estimate the range offsets between the input SLCS
    - Coregister the secondary SLC by applying the estimated range and azimuth offsets
    - Produce the wrapped phase interferogram
    - If --apply-water-mask is selected, create and apply the water mask to the wrapped interferogram.
    - Unwrap the wrapped phase interferogram using SNAPHU to produce the wrapped phase interferogram
- topsapp.run_topsapp_burst(start='geocode', end='geocode', config_xml=config_path): Geocode the output products

## Post-Processing ##
 - translate_outputs: Convert the outputs of hyp3-isce2 to hyp3-gamma formatted geotiff files
 - make_readme_file: Produce the readme.md.txt file in the product
 - make_parameter_file: Produce metadata text file in the product
 - make_archive: Zip the output files
 - upload_file_to_s3: Upload the files in the product directory to the s3 bucket
