### Pixel Spacing ###

When ordering Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR On Demand products, users can choose the number of looks to use in processing,
which drives the resolution and pixel spacing of the output products. The available options are 20x4, 10x2, or 5x1.
The first number indicates the number of looks in range, the second is the number of looks in azimuth.

The output product pixel spacing depends on the number of looks in azimuth:
pixel spacing = 20 * azimuth looks

Products with 20x4 looks have a pixel spacing of 80 m, those with 10x2 looks have a pixel spacing of 40 m, and
those with 5x1 looks have a pixel spacing of 20 m.

This product uses {{ range_looks }} range looks and {{ azimuth_looks }} azimuth looks, resulting in a pixel spacing
of {{ pixel_spacing|int }} m.

Interferometric SAR (InSAR) uses the phase differences from repeat passes over the same area to identify regions where
the distance between the sensor and the earth's surface has changed. This allows for the detection and quantification
of deformation or movement.

These burst-based products are generated from pairs of individual bursts acquired by Sentinel-1. ESA packages
collections of bursts into SLC products for distribution. These SLCs cover large areas, resulting in large file sizes.
In cases where only a small area of the SLC is of interest, extracting individual bursts from the SLC allows InSAR
processing to be performed much more quickly and efficiently than processing an entire SLC pair.

In addition to the efficiencies provided by the smaller file size, Sentinel-1 bursts are consistent in their footprint.
The framing of SLCs is not always consistent along a path, so bursts may be included at the top of one SLC for one
pass and the bottom of the next SLC for a different pass. This makes it more difficult to find and process all the
acquisitions available for a specific burst over time. When searching through time at the burst level, you can be
assured that your stack includes all the acquisitions for that burst footprint.

Note that the imaging surface will vary depending on the sensor wavelength. Because Sentinel-1 is a C-band sensor,
the waves will not penetrate very deeply into vegetation. The imagery likely represents the top of the canopy in
densely vegetated areas rather than the actual terrain. In addition, vegetated areas tend to have low coherence,
because plants can grow or move from one acquisition to the next. Use caution when generating interferograms for
areas with extensive/dense vegetation cover.

A digital elevation model is required for processing InSAR. The DEM used for this particular product is the
Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM, which has a native resolution of 1 arc second (about 30 meters). This DEM is a
global Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from the WorldDEM. The WorldDEM is based on radar satellite data
acquired by the TanDEM-X mission, which was funded by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space,
and edited to flatten water bodies, provide consistent flow of rivers, and apply corrections to shore/coastlines and
special features. For an overview of the dataset, visit

----------------
## 1. Wrapped Interferogram

The wrapped interferogram is generated from the interferogram phase prior to unwrapping and output as a GeoTIFF.

The values contained in this raster are on a wrapped 2-pi scale rather than representing continuous phase difference
values, resulting in the appearance of fringes in areas with surface deformation. Each 2-pi cycle is equivalent to
about 2.8 cm in line-of-sight displacement (half the wavelength of the Sentinel-1 sensor, which is about 5.6 cm),
so areas with fringes that are very close together indicate greater amounts of deformation in the line-of-sight
direction from the sensor.

The wrapped interferogram file is tagged with wrapped_phase.tif

----------------
## 2. Unwrapped Interferogram

The unwrapped interferogram uses a reference point to convert the wrapped 2-pi scale into a continuous scale (of
multiples of pi), and is the most important and complicated step in InSAR processing. The statistical-cost
network-flow algorithm for phase unwrapping (SNAPHU) (https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.18.000338) was used for phase
unwrapping this product, and the reference point was set internally by SNAPHU in a manner that minimizes the
statistical cost of the resulting unwrapped solution.

The GeoTIFF contains the unwrapped phase difference values for each pixel, corresponding to the change in distance
along the line of sight of the sensor. Positive values indicate movement away from the sensor (caused by subsidence
or lateral movement away from the sensor) and negative values indicate movement towards the sensor (uplift or lateral
movement towards the sensor). Note that deformation often includes both vertical and horizontal components, and
additional processing or external reference data is required to calculate the relative contributions of vertical
and lateral movement.

The PNG file displays the unwrapped phase as a gray scale image. Lighter pixels represent positive values
(e.g., movement away from the sensor relative to the reference pixel), and darker pixels represent negative values
(e.g., movement towards the sensor relative to the reference pixel).

Because unwrapped phase differences and displacement values are calculated relative to the reference point,
you may wish to apply a correction to the image so that the range of values are more appropriate for your study area
or application. Refer to the Phase Unwrapping Reference Point section of the InSAR Product Guide
(https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/insar_product_guide/#phase-unwrapping-reference-point)
for guidance on applying a correction to this raster relative to a different reference point.

In regions of large-magnitude deformations or extremely steep topography, the fringes may be too close together to
resolve, or one fringe may actually represent a jump of multiple phase wraps. ISCE2 software uses the SNAPHU algorithm
to detect phase inconsistencies and treat them appropriately, but some deformations may still be too large to generate
reliable data.

It is important to be aware that phase unwrapping errors can and do occur.

One potential source of error is the presence of extensive surface water (coastal areas or large inland waterbodies).
In some cases, signal returns over surface water meet the coherence threshold criteria, even though measurements over
water should not be coherent. When this happens, phase unwrapping can occur over expanses of water, leading to
unexpected/invalid phase unwrapping results over land. Masking areas of water before unwrapping is a common approach
used to mitigate this issue, but ISCE2 does not currently support this functionality. Thus, use caution when
interpreting unwrapped phase results close to surface water.

There is the option to apply a water mask *after* phase unwrapping. While it doesn't correct for phase unwrapping
errors over water, it can make the interferograms less visually distracting. This product
{{ "has" if apply_water_mask else "has not" }} had a water mask applied.

No atmospheric correction has been applied to this interferogram. While SAR signals can penetrate clouds,
atmospheric conditions can delay the transmission of the signal, resulting in phase differences between acquisition
that can look like surface deformation signals. Use caution when interpreting single interferograms. In some cases,
atmospheric models can be used to remove these impacts. Time series analysis may also be helpful for identifying and
correcting both unwrapping errors and atmospheric impacts.

The unwrapped interferogram files are tagged with _unw_phase, and the _unw_phase.tif file contains the data values.
The PNG is 2048 pixels wide.

----------------
## 3. Coherence Map

The spectra of the two images used for InSAR must overlap well enough to generate interferometric fringes. Areas
without common overlap must be filtered out prior to InSAR generation. The correlation indicates the accuracy of the
phase information, or the visibility of fringes. Areas with low correlation will have noisier phase. The magnitude
of the correlation is commonly referred to as coherence. The coherence map is output as a GeoTIFF with values ranging
from 0 to 1; the larger the number, the higher the coherence (and the better the correlation).

The coherence map is tagged with _corr.tif

----------------
## 4. Connected Components

The connected components file delineates regions unwrapped as contiguous units by the SNAPHU unwrapping algorithm.
In general, products with fewer and larger regions will have higher quality phase unwrapping results than products
with many small regions. This file is used by post-processors such as MintPy to correct unwrapping errors.

The connected components file is tagged with _conncomp.tif

----------------
## 5. Parameter Documentation

The text file included with the product lists the key processing parameters used, including the filenames of the
reference and secondary bursts used, baseline length, number of looks, output resolution, and source DEM information.

The text file is not tagged; it has a .txt extension on the base filename.

----------------
## 6. Look Vector Maps

Two look vector maps are output with as GeoTIFFs. The look vector refers to the look direction back towards the sensor.
The lv_theta (θ) and lv_phi (φ) describe the elevation and orientation angles of the look vector in radians.

The lv_theta map indicates the SAR look vector elevation angle at each pixel, ranging from -π/2 (down) to π/2 (up).
The look vector elevation angle is defined as the angle between the horizontal surface and the look vector with
positive angles indicating sensor positions above the surface.

The lv_phi map indicates indicates the SAR look vector orientation angle at each pixel. The look vector orientation
angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the projection of the look vector on the horizontal
surface plane. The orientation angle increases towards north, with the North direction corresponding
to π/2 (and south to -π/2). The orientation angle range is -π to π.

The lv_theta map is required for applying atmospheric corrections, and for calculating vertical displacement values
relative to a new phase unwrapping reference point.

----------------
## 7. DEM used to process the data

This is a copy of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layer used for processing. This layer is tagged with _dem.tif,
and is a 16-bit signed integer GeoTIFF.

The DEM used for this product is {{ dem_name }}, which has a native pixel spacing of {{ dem_pixel_spacing }}.
The Copernicus DEM GLO-30 is a global Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from the WorldDEM. The WorldDEM is based on
radar satellite data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission, which was funded by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Airbus
Defence and Space, and edited to flatten water bodies, provide consistent flow of rivers, and apply corrections to
shore/coastlines and special features. For an overview of the dataset, visit
https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/collections/copernicus-digital-elevation-model.

----------------
## 8. Water Mask

The water mask identifies coastal waters and major inland waterbodies. These areas are assigned a pixel value of 0.
All remaining pixels (land, islands in large lakes, small inland waterbodies, and landfast Antarctic ice) have
a value of 1. The water mask is stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer GeoTIFF file and is always included in the product
package.

Users can choose to apply the water mask to output products, which affects the wrapped interferogram,
the unwrapped interferogram, and the browse image. It returns NoData values over the areas covered by the water mask
in these output images. This product {{ "has" if apply_water_mask else "has not" }} had the water mask applied.

The water mask is generated using the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG)
dataset (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines). To generate the global mask, we combined the full-resolution
L1 and L5 datasets, and removed the L2 dataset minus the L3 dataset. The L1 dataset is the boundary between land
and ocean, excluding Antarctica, and the L5 dataset is the boundary between Antarctic ice and ocean. The L2
dataset is the boundary between lakes and land, and the L3 dataset is the boundary between islands and the
lakes they are within. The GSHHG dataset was last updated in 2017, so there may be discrepancies where
shorelines have changed.

ISCE2 currently only supports applying a water mask to an interferogram *after* phase unwrapping. Note that
applying the mask after phase unwrapping does not prevent unwrapping errors caused by the inclusion of water pixels
as valid data during the phase unwrapping process. When phase unwrapping occurs over large expanses of water, it can
lead to unexpected deformation signals or phase jumps in the unwrapped outputs, and the current masking approach
does not correct for these impacts.

# The Sentinel-1 mission #

The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation program, coordinated by the
European Space Agency (ESA) on behalf of the European Commission (EC). Sentinel-1 satellites carry C-band
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments for global, around-the-clock imagery, even through cloud cover.

The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and remains active. The Sentinel-1B satellite was launched
April 25, 2016, and was active until December 23, 2021. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle and use the
same orbit pattern, but are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days while both are active. Since the
mission ended for S1B, there are some significant gaps in coverage. A reduced acquisition plan will be in place
until Sentinel-1C is launched (expected in 2023) to replace Sentinel-1B.
Visit https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/sentinel1/ for more information.
